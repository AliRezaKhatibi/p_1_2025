# Using neural networks for data classification
use neural network for make a model with use tensorflow
In this project, unreal data (the data has two features) has been used, which is two types of data with zero and one labels, the frequency of one type of data is in the center and the other is spread, and the data has been categorized with neural networks and the number of different layers and neurons, and finally, the accuracy of the model has been increased by cleaning and removing noise.
